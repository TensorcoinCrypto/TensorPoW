# TensorPoW
The Fastest Blockchain, Powered by GPUs

## Usage

1. Run `python bruteforce.py` and enter a transaction amount when prompted.
2. The script generates a random sender/recipient, computes a hashed block using a
   24‑bit seed and verifies the transaction immediately.

PyTorch is used if available for GPU acceleration. If it is not installed, the
scripts fall back to CPU with `numpy`.
